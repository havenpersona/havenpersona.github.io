I'm a first-year PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego, where I'm incredibly fortunate to work with Professor [Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley).

### Email
You can always email me at khaven@ucsd.edu.

### In-person Communication
I also welcome in-person communication for mentoring or collaboration requests. You can find me at my office in the CSE building at UCSD during my office hours (unless I’m sick, in a meeting, or attending a conference).

My tentative **office hours (until March 26, 2025) are from 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays**. I update my office hours quarterly.

### Mentoring
Since I’ve reached my maximum capacity and am currently mentoring several students, I’m unable to accept additional mentoring requests at this time. Thank you for your understanding.

### Collaboration
I always welcome and appreciate opportunities for academic collaboration. Please feel free to email me if you have any ideas.

### Hobby
When I’m not working, I enjoy cooking and finding healthy recipes. I also work out and spend time with friends.

### Personality
I consider myself responsible and considerate. People often describe me as self-disciplined, which I take as a compliment.

### CV
My CV is available on [this webpage](https://havenpersona.github.io/cv)
